# What I Know about Git

Hi! I'm new to GitHub and programming in general but I'll try my best to explain the features I know of GitHub as well as what it is.


# What is it?

GitHub is a form of version control which allows you to keep track of files as you work as well as allow you to have different version of your work without the need of making multiple copies. 
## Snapshots

GitHub works through Snapshots. Snapshots saves your work and is accompanied by a message of what you did. 
## Branches

Branches allow you to trace back to which snapshot your work has originated from.
## Branch Names

Branches are named so that they associate with their parent snapshot.
## Merges

When working with others, merges allows you to combine your work with someone else's and specifies that your snapshot is from two users.

I can't remember much off of the top of my head regarding Git but I hope this was descriptive enough of some basic Git features, thanks!
