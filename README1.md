Committing a file is like uploading it for everyone to see

## Branches
Your main branch for which your commits will be shown on is the master branch. You can create sub branches to denote different versions or experimental projects. 

## Repositories
Basically your project.

## Using Terminal/Command Line
You can use terminal or command line to directly push or commit files stored in a directory.

## Snapshots
A way to track your progess and have others view your progress.

## Merging and Rewriting History
Merging your commits and rewriting history can condense and clean up any duplicated files or commits that can be merged together.
